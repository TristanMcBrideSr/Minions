## 🎮 Instantly Switch Minion Modes! (No Restarts!)

Want *basic* minions for simple demos?
Want *advanced* minions who collaborate?
Want *speaking* minions to liven up the classroom or living room?
**No problem! Pick and switch—while your program is running!**

---

## 🧙‍♂️ How It Works

* **Start the program:**

* **Pick your minion mode:**

  ```
  ## Autonomous Minions Demo System

  Available Minion types:
  1: Basic Minions
  2: Advanced Minions
  3: Speaking Minions
  -------------------

  Select Minion by number (default: 1):
  ```

* **Enter your question or task!**

* **Switch minion type anytime:**
  Just type `:switch` at the prompt—no need to restart!

---

## 🔄 Why Runtime Mode Switching Rocks

* Perfect for **classrooms:** Try different AI teaching modes without tech headaches.
* **Kids can experiment** and see instant changes—no boring “stop and restart.”
* **Demos** are seamless. Show off “quiet” minions, “smart” minions, or “loud” minions with a single command!

## 🛠️ How to Add More Minions (For Grownups & Curious Kids!)

Want to make a **pirate minion**? A **robot minion**?
Just add to `CHOICE_MAP` and `PROCESS_MAP`, then make your own minion module. The program will pick it up and you can swap in live!

## 🍌 Why This Project?

* **Teaches decomposition:** Minions break up big jobs.
* **Encourages exploration:** Switch minions, see what happens.
* **No downtime:** Change everything, keep coding, keep playing.
* **For all ages:** Friendly for beginners and fun for pros.
